## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Exam Request Creation

Requests can be created:
- By a doctor from within a clinical note (M7) — pre-linked to appointment
- By receptionist on behalf of patient — standalone request
- By patient via WhatsApp bot or portal (Phase 4)

Request form captures:
- Patient (linked to CRM)
- Exam service type
- Requesting doctor
- Urgency: Routine / Urgent / Stat
- Clinical notes / indication
- Preferred date/time

On creation, the patient receives automatic WhatsApp message with preparation instructions (e.g., fasting requirements for abdominal ultrasound).

### 3.2 Lab / Technician Worklist

- Filtered view: assigned to me / all pending / in-progress / resulted
- Sort by urgency then scheduled time
- Mark as `sample_collected`, `in_progress`, `resulted`
- Assign to a specific technician

### 3.3 Result Upload

Staff (nurse, lab_tech) uploads result file:
- File types: PDF (reports), JPEG/PNG (images), DICOM (Phase 4 — imaging)
- Max file size: 20MB per upload
- Text summary field (optional — for quick doctor reference)
- File stored in Cloudflare R2 under `exam-results/{patient_id}/{exam_id}/`

On upload:
1. Exam request status → `resulted`
2. Secure download token generated (72h expiry)
3. Patient notified via `exam_result_ready` WhatsApp template
4. Referring doctor notified via in-app notification

### 3.4 Secure Patient Download

- Patient receives WhatsApp link: `https://files.maissaudecv.com/results/{token}`
- Token validated server-side; if expired → returns helpful error with clinic contact
- Download event logged in `audit_log` (timestamp, IP address)
- Files accessible from patient CRM timeline indefinitely (admin/doctor access)

- Download links expire after 72 hours; patient can request a new link via bot or reception
- DICOM files are stored but viewer integration (Cornerstone.js) is Phase 4
