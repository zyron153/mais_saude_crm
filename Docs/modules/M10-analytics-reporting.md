## 3. Data Architecture

Analytics read from **materialised views** refreshed nightly (or on-demand):
- `mv_daily_appointments` — see `DATABASE-SCHEMA.md`
- `mv_monthly_revenue`
- Additional views added per report as needed

Real-time KPIs (today's data) query live tables with date filters and appropriate indexes.

No separate data warehouse at MVP scale; revisit if data exceeds 5M rows.
