### 2.1 SOAP Note Editor

Each completed appointment can have one clinical note in SOAP format:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **S — Subjective** | Patient-reported complaint, symptoms, history |
| **O — Objective** | Physical examination findings, vitals (BP, HR, temp, weight) |
| **A — Assessment** | Diagnosis with ICD-10 codes (Portuguese descriptions) |
| **P — Plan** | Treatment: medication, follow-up, referrals, exams ordered |

- Rich text editor (no markdown — simple formatting only)
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Notes locked 24 hours after creation (admin can unlock with reason)
- Doctor sees patient summary (demographics, active plan, last 3 visits) in sidebar while writing

### 2.2 ICD-10 Code Search

- Searchable ICD-10 database with Portuguese disease descriptions
- Type diagnosis name or code → dropdown of matching codes
- Multiple codes per assessment field
- Most frequently used codes pre-populated for each specialty

### 2.3 Prescription Generator

From within a clinical note:
- Add drug with name, dosage, frequency, duration, special instructions
- Multiple drugs per prescription
- Prescription printable as PDF (Mais Saúde letterhead)
- Prescription attached to patient CRM timeline

### 2.4 Referrals

Internal referrals:
- Select another Mais Saúde doctor by specialty

### 2.5 Exam Requests from Notes

Doctor can create an exam request (M5) directly from the Plan section of a SOAP note. The exam is pre-linked to the current consultation.
