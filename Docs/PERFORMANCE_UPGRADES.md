## ✅ Phase 1 — Full-Stack Performance Instrumentation

Instruments the full stack so every future optimization has a before/after measurement. Nothing optimized — only measured.

### Backend (3 files)

**`apps/api/src/common/context/request-context.ts`** — NEW
Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` scopes per-request state through the entire call stack including Prisma callbacks.

**`apps/api/src/common/interceptors/performance.interceptor.ts`** — NEW
Wraps every request. On response sets headers:
- `X-Request-Id`, `X-Request-Duration`, `X-Query-Count`, `X-Query-Time`

Logs `[PERF]` for every request and `[SLOW]` for requests >100ms. Registered as the first `APP_INTERCEPTOR` in `app.module.ts`.

**`apps/api/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`** — MODIFIED
Enabled `log: [{ emit: 'event', level: 'query' }]`. Pushes each query's duration to `RequestContext`. Warns on slow queries (>100ms).

### Frontend (4 files)

**`apps/web/app/web-vitals.tsx`** — NEW
`useReportWebVitals` hook (Next.js built-in). Logs LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB to console with color-coded rating. Pushes to perf store.

**`apps/web/lib/perf-store.ts`** — NEW
Zustand store tracking per-route metrics: transition time, API calls, duplicate calls, SQL query count/time, Web Vitals. Monkey-patches `window.fetch` to intercept timing and read `X-Query-*` response headers.

**`apps/web/components/dev/PerfPanel.tsx`** — NEW
Floating ⚡ PERF overlay (bottom-right, `z-[9999]`). Shows route transition time, API calls, duplicate detection (DUP label), SQL stats, Web Vitals. Dev only.

**`apps/web/app/(app)/layout.tsx`** — MODIFIED
Added `<PerfPanel />` (dev only).

### Bundle Analyzer
- Added `@next/bundle-analyzer` to `apps/web/package.json`
- `next.config.ts` wraps config with `withBundleAnalyzer({ enabled: ANALYZE === 'true' })`
- Run: `ANALYZE=true pnpm --filter @cms/web build`

---

## ✅ Phase 2 — API Waterfall Detection & Audit

Read-only audit of all pages and backend services. No code changes.

### Frontend findings

| ID | Page | Issue | Severity |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| F1 | appointments | No `staleTime` — every revisit refetches | Medium |
| F2 | appointments | Socket invalidates all `["appointments"]` queries (too broad) | High |
| F3 | appointments | Query key doesn't encode date range | Medium |
| F4 | patients | No `staleTime` | Medium |
| F5 | patients | Plan filter applied client-side after fetching all rows | Low |
| F6 | patients/[id] | 2 HTTP requests for 1 screen (patient + timeline) | High |
| F7 | patients/[id] | No `staleTime` on either query | Medium |
| F8 | billing | KPI cards (Emitidas, Receita, Vencidas) always show "—" — never fetched | Medium |
| F9 | billing | No `staleTime` | Medium |
| F10 | billing/[id] | Payment mutation invalidates all `["invoices"]` (over-invalidation) | Medium |
| F11 | billing/[id] | No `staleTime` | Medium |

### Backend findings

| ID | Service | Issue | Severity |
|----|---------|-------|----------|
| B1 | appointments.reschedule | N+1 Bull queue loop — 3 sequential `getJob()` calls | High |
| B2 | appointments.getAvailability | 2 independent queries run sequentially | Low |
| B3 | patients.create | Phone + NIF uniqueness checks run sequentially | Low |
| B4 | patients.findAll | No `select` — returns full row including encrypted NIF | Medium |
| B5 | patients.findById | Returns flat patient, no health plan relation | Medium |
| B6 | billing.recordPayment | 3 sequential queries; first over-fetches full invoice to read `total` | High |
| B7 | billing.findById | Always includes `items + payments` — wasteful for receipt endpoint | Medium |
| B8 | billing.update | Returns `items + payments` after payment when only status needed | Low |
| B9 | healthPlans.findAllPlans | Always includes full `product` (with `coverageRules` JSON) + full `company` | Medium |
| B10 | companies.deactivate | Loads full company + health plans tree just to check existence | Low |

## ✅ Phase 3 — BFF (Backend for Frontend) Endpoints

Created screen-oriented endpoints that collapse multiple API calls into one.

### New files

**`apps/api/src/modules/bff/bff.service.ts`**
- `getPatientScreen(id)` — 4 parallel Prisma queries in a single request:
  patient (with `healthPlan.name`), appointments (take 20), communications (take 20), invoices (take 20). Assembles and sorts timeline server-side. Fixes F6 + B5.
- `getBillingSummary()` — 3 parallel aggregates: issued count, collected amount, overdue count (this month). Fixes F8.

**`apps/api/src/modules/bff/bff.controller.ts`**
- `GET /v1/bff/patient-screen/:id`
- `GET /v1/bff/billing-summary`

**`apps/api/src/modules/bff/bff.module.ts`** — imports `PrismaModule`.

### Modified files

**`apps/api/src/app.module.ts`** — imports `BffModule`.

**`apps/api/src/modules/appointments/appointments.service.ts`**
- Fixed B1: replaced `for` loop with `Promise.all` for Bull queue lookups.

**`apps/api/src/modules/patients/patients.service.ts`**
- Fixed B3: phone + NIF uniqueness checks now run in parallel via `Promise.all`.

**`apps/api/src/modules/patients/patients.repository.ts`**
- Reduced timeline `take: 50 → 20` per collection.

**`apps/web/app/(app)/patients/[id]/page.tsx`**
- Replaced 2 `useQuery` calls with 1 BFF call to `/api/bff/patient-screen/:id`. Fixes F6.
- Now shows `healthPlan.name` instead of generic "Plano Ativo" badge. Fixes B5.
- Added `staleTime: 60_000`. Fixes F7.

**`apps/web/app/(app)/billing/page.tsx`**
- Added `useQuery` for `/api/bff/billing-summary` with `staleTime: 60_000`. Fixes F8.
- KPI cards (Emitidas, Receita Cobrada, Vencidas) now show real values.
- Added `staleTime: 30_000` on the invoices list query. Fixes F9.

## ✅ Phase 4 — Frontend Data Loading Tuning

Tuned React Query across all live-data pages. Targets: F1, F2, F3, F4, F10, F11.

### Global (`apps/web/app/providers.tsx`) — MODIFIED

Added to QueryClient defaults:
- `gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000` — keeps cache alive 10 min after last observer detaches; survives React 19 StrictMode remount cycles
- `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` — eliminated DUPs caused by DevTools open/close triggering window blur+focus re-fetches

### Appointments page (`apps/web/app/(app)/appointments/page.tsx`) — MODIFIED

- **F1**: Added `staleTime: 60_000` to the calendar query
- **F3**: Moved `from`/`to` date computation to component scope; both now included in queryKey: `["appointments", "calendar", from, to]`
- **F2**: Socket `invalidateQueries` now targets the exact key `["appointments", "calendar", from, to]` instead of the over-broad `["appointments"]` prefix
- **Bug fix**: `to` date now uses `new Date(year, month+1, 0).getDate()` — eliminates hardcoded `-31` that produced `Invalid Date` on months with < 31 days (e.g. June → 500 error)
- Socket `reconnectionAttempts: 3` — stops console spam when API server is not running

### Patients page (`apps/web/app/(app)/patients/page.tsx`) — MODIFIED

- **F4**: Added explicit `staleTime: 30_000` (previously relying silently on global default)

### Billing detail page (`apps/web/app/(app)/billing/[id]/page.tsx`) — MODIFIED

- **F11**: Added `staleTime: 60_000` to the invoice detail query
- **F10**: `payMutation.onSuccess` now also invalidates `["billing-summary"]` so KPI cards on the billing list page reflect the payment immediately; list invalidation via `["invoices"]` prefix is intentionally kept broad (all pages/filters should reflect the payment)

---

## ✅ Phase 5 — Navigation Optimization

Reduced blank-screen time when navigating between routes.

### Sidebar prefetch (`apps/web/app/(app)/sidebar.tsx`) — MODIFIED

Added `prefetch={true}` to all sidebar `<Link>` elements. In Next.js 15 App Router, the default partial prefetch downloads only the loading skeleton; `prefetch={true}` also downloads the full page JS bundle while the user is viewing the sidebar. Since all sidebar links are always in the viewport, all bundles are downloaded eagerly after the layout mounts — navigation becomes instant in production.

> Hover-based `router.prefetch()` was investigated and ruled out: links are permanently in viewport, so viewport-based prefetch already fires immediately. Hover adds no benefit.

### Route-specific loading skeletons

The single `app/(app)/loading.tsx` (generic KPI-cards + table) was shown for ALL routes, including ones with a completely different layout. Added two route-specific skeletons that match the actual page structure:

**`apps/web/app/(app)/appointments/loading.tsx`** — NEW
Calendar-matching skeleton: header with view-toggle + CTA, 4 stats pills row, status legend pills, FullCalendar-shaped grid (toolbar + 7-col day headers + 5-week cell grid with scattered event placeholders).

**`apps/web/app/(app)/patients/loading.tsx`** — NEW
Patients-matching skeleton: header + button, search bar + filter, table with avatar + name + phone + plan columns, pagination row. No KPI cards (generic had 4 that don't exist on this page).

## ⬜ Phase 6 — Database Query Optimization

Add missing indexes, reduce over-fetching on high-traffic queries.

- Fix B4: add `select` to `patients.findAll` to exclude encrypted NIF, emergency contacts
- Fix B6: rewrite `billing.recordPayment` to fetch only `{ total, status }` in query 1
- Fix B7: create a `findByIdLite` variant that excludes `items + payments` for receipt/status checks
- Fix B9: add `select` to `healthPlans.findAllPlans` to exclude `coverageRules` JSON blob
- Fix B10: replace full include in `companies.deactivate` with `findFirst({ where: { id } })` existence check
- Audit and add composite indexes for common filter patterns (patient timeline, invoice by status+date)

---

## ⬜ Phase 7 — Final Implementation Pass

Apply remaining fixes one at a time with before/after measurements from the ⚡ PERF panel and `[PERF]` API logs.

1. Run baseline measurement on each affected route
2. Apply fix
3. Re-measure and record delta
4. Commit with timing numbers in the commit message
