## Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)

These are the highest-priority unblocked tasks right now:

1. **Fix `GET /appointments/:id`** — currently returns all appointments instead of one record (`appointments.controller.ts:56`)
2. **Add `StaffModule` + `ServicesModule`** — `GET /staff` and `GET /services` are missing, which blocks the booking UI dropdowns
3. **Add Next.js auth layer** — `AuthGuard` in `(app)/layout.tsx`, API client with Bearer token, login callback handler
4. **Set up Keycloak dev realm** — create realm `maissaude`, clients `api` and `web`, all 7 roles
5. **Implement PDF receipt generation** — `@react-pdf/renderer` + R2 upload in `billing.service.ts:getReceiptUrl`
6. **New invoice form** — `/billing/new` page is missing (linked from billing list but not created)
7. **Unit tests** — `patients.service.spec.ts`, `appointments.service.spec.ts`, `billing.service.spec.ts`
8. **Patient edit form** — `/patients/[id]/edit` page missing
