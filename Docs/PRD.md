## 1. Executive Summary

Mais Saúde CV is a private healthcare clinic located in Palmarejo, Praia, Cabo Verde, offering:

- Specialist medical consultations (Cardiology, Paediatrics, Gynaecology, Ophthalmology)
- Dental services (cavity treatment, whitening, orthodontic maintenance)
- Diagnostic exams (ECG, Holter, MAPA, Echocardiogram)
- Ultrasound imaging (Abdominal, Pelvic, Mammary, Scrotal, Prostatic, Neck, Soft Tissue, Thyroid)
- Home-visit medical and nursing services
- Family and Corporate Health Plans

A comprehensive audit of the clinic's website ([maissaudecv.com](https://maissaudecv.com)) reveals a critical operational gap: **every patient-facing call-to-action (CTA) redirects to a single WhatsApp number (+238 522 42 00)**. This means:

- All scheduling is manual and handled through informal chat messages
- There is no centralised patient record, appointment calendar, or billing system
- Staff spend significant time on repetitive coordination tasks instead of clinical care
- Patient experience is inconsistent, with no automated reminders, confirmations, or follow-ups
- Business intelligence (patient volume, revenue, no-show rates) is effectively zero

> **Strategic Goal:** Replace the WhatsApp-only workflow with a purpose-built Healthcare ERP/CRM — **Mais Saúde 360** — that automates scheduling, patient management, billing, and internal operations, while retaining WhatsApp as a structured, trackable communication channel.

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Website CTA Audit

| CTA Label | Location | Destination | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agendar Consulta | Hero banner (primary button) | WhatsApp wa.link/8jooz1 | No structured data captured |
| Agenda a sua consulta | Hero section (secondary) | WhatsApp API +238 522 42 00 | No calendar, no confirmation |
| Entre em Contato | About Us section | Contact page → WhatsApp | Manual routing required |
| Agendar Consulta | Health Plans section | WhatsApp API +238 522 42 00 | No plan selection flow |
| Saiba Mais (Consultas) | Specialty listing | Internal page only | No booking from listing |
| Saiba Mais (Exames) | Exam listing | Internal page only | No exam request form |
| WhatsApp floating widget | All pages (bottom-right) | WhatsApp chat | Untracked conversations |
| Newsletter form | Footer | Email only | Not linked to CRM |

### 2.2 Pain Points Identified

#### Operational Pain Points
- No-show risk with zero automated reminders or confirmations
- Double-booking possible as appointments are tracked manually or not at all
- Staff context-switching between WhatsApp, phone calls, and paper registers
- Health plan subscribers have no self-service portal for appointments or history
- Home-visit scheduling requires extra coordination with no route optimisation

#### Clinical Pain Points
- No centralised patient history — doctors have no prior visit context
- Exam results cannot be digitally delivered or archived per patient
- Referral tracking between specialties is absent

#### Business Pain Points
- Revenue leakage from untracked consultations and unissued invoices
- No reporting on most requested services, peak hours, or patient demographics
- Health plan renewal rates are untracked, risking churn
- Marketing effectiveness (which channel drives bookings) is unmeasurable

## 3. Proposed Solution: Mais Saúde 360 Platform

We propose developing **Mais Saúde 360**, a cloud-based, Portuguese-language Healthcare ERP/CRM platform tailored to the clinic's service mix and the Cabo Verde digital infrastructure context. The platform will be web-based with a companion mobile app, and will integrate with WhatsApp Business API to preserve the familiar communication channel while adding structure and automation.

> **Platform Philosophy:** Keep WhatsApp as a patient-facing touchpoint — but route everything through a centralised system. Patients interact the way they already do; the clinic gains data, automation, and control.

All inbound WhatsApp messages are routed through the backend first, logged to CRM, then either bot-handled or escalated to the agent inbox.

## 10. Success Metrics & KPIs

| KPI | Current Baseline | 6-Month Target | 12-Month Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Appointment no-show rate | Unknown (est. > 20%) | < 15% | < 10% |
| Online bookings (% of total) | 0% | 40% | 70% |
| WhatsApp avg. response time | Unknown / manual | < 45 min | < 20 min (bot + agent) |
| Patient record completeness | 0% (no system) | 80% | 95% |
| Health plan renewal rate | Unknown | > 70% | > 85% |
| Invoice-to-payment cycle time | Manual / unclear | < 48 hours | < 24 hours |
| Staff time on admin (hrs/week) | Est. 20+ hrs | < 12 hrs | < 6 hrs |
| Exam result delivery time | Manual / unclear | < 4 hours | < 2 hours (auto-notify) |
| Monthly active patients (tracked) | 0 | 100% | 100% + segmented |

---

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Staff resistance to new system | High | High | Phased rollout; hands-on training; keep WhatsApp as supplemental channel during transition |
| Unreliable internet connectivity in CV | Medium | High | Offline-capable mobile app; critical booking functions cached locally; SMS fallback |
| Patient adoption of online booking | Medium | High | WhatsApp bot as primary onramp (familiar channel); QR codes in clinic to booking widget |
| WhatsApp API approval delays (Meta) | Medium | Medium | Engage BSP early in Phase 1; use unofficial API for testing; maintain manual fallback |
| Data migration from existing records | Low | Medium | Structured import template; data audit sprint before go-live; parallel run period |
| Budget overrun on custom development | Medium | High | Consider extending open-source EMR (OpenMRS, Bahmni) to reduce build cost |
| Regulatory / data privacy gaps | Low | High | Engage local legal counsel on CV health data law; document all consent flows |

---

## 12. Build vs. Buy: Open Source Alternatives

Before committing to full custom development, the following open-source healthcare platforms should be evaluated as accelerators:

| Platform | Best For | Gaps for Mais Saúde | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bahmni (OpenMRS) | Full EMR + hospital management; strong in Africa/Asia | No WhatsApp bot; booking widget needs custom build | ✅ Strong base for M7 |
| Odoo (Community) | ERP: billing, CRM, scheduling modules | No clinical/medical records; heavy configuration needed | ✅ Good for M4/M6/M8 |
| HospitalRun | Lightweight clinic management, offline support | Limited speciality modules; inactive maintainership | ⚠️ Evaluate cautiously |
| Cal.com (self-hosted) | Scheduling and booking engine | Not healthcare-specific; no CRM or billing | ✅ Good for M1 only |
| **Custom (Recommended)** | All 10 modules designed around Mais Saúde workflows | Higher upfront cost; longer build time | ⭐ Best long-term fit |

> **Recommendation:** Use **Odoo Community** as the ERP backbone (billing, HR, health plans) and build custom modules for Appointment Engine, WhatsApp Integration, and EMR-lite on top. This hybrid approach reduces development time by an estimated 30–40%.
